Fast generator of Hamming neighborhoods of hexadecimal strings
==============================================================

The strings are assumed to encode a binary number of a fixed length that is not necessarily divisible by four. For example, 101101 would be encoded as "b1". Long strings are supported.

Copy hngen.h, hngen.cpp and consthammingNeighborhoods.h to where you need the library, then include hngen.h. It is a pretty self explanatory header.
